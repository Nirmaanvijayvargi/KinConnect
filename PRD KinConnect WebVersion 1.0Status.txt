PRD: KinConnect WebVersion: 1.0Status: Draft / ConceptualTech Goal: React + Ant Design + Gemini API1. Executive SummaryKinConnect is a web-based AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) tool designed for stroke survivors. Unlike traditional apps, it uses familiar imagery—photos of the user's actual environment—to bridge the gap between intent and communication.2. User PersonasThe Survivor (User): Needs high-contrast, large-hit-area buttons and zero navigation depth.The Caregiver (Admin): Needs a simple interface to upload photos and "label" the world for the survivor.3. Functional RequirementsFeatureDescriptionPriorityFamily Image UploadCaregiver uploads photos of real objects (e.g., "Buddy the dog").P0AI Auto-TaggingGemini API analyzes photos to suggest labels (e.g., "Drink," "Medication").P0The "Grid" ViewA simplified, full-screen dashboard of these photos for the survivor.P1Audio SynthesisClicking a photo triggers a Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice saying the intent.P1Contextual FilteringThe UI changes buttons based on time (Breakfast items appear 7 AM – 10 AM).P24. Technical Architecture (React + Ant Design)Frontend Components (Ant Design)Layout: Layout and Content for a clean, distraction-free environment.Image Handling: Upload (Dragger) for the Caregiver to bulk-upload household photos.The Grid: Card and List components for the survivor's interface. Cards should be large with minimal text.Feedback: Message or Notification for "Message Sent to Caregiver" confirmation.Backend/AI LogicImage Analysis:Input: Caregiver Upload.Processing: Send image to Gemini 1.5 Flash (highly efficient for vision).Prompt: "Identify the primary object in this home photo and provide a one-word label for a stroke survivor."State Management: Use React Context API or Redux to manage the "Active Tiles" based on the time of day.5. Design Principles for AphasiaNo "Nesting": Avoid menus inside menus. Everything must be 1–2 clicks away.High Contrast: Use Ant Design’s primary colors against a clean white or dark background.Visual Dominance: Text should be secondary to the photo. The photo is the "trigger."6. User FlowSetup (Caregiver): Opens web app -> Uploads photo of the family coffee mug -> Gemini tags it as "Water/Coffee" -> Saved to Firebase.Usage (Survivor): Opens web app on a tablet -> Sees a large photo of their mug -> Taps it -> App speaks: "I would like a drink." -> Notification sent to Caregiver’s phone.
