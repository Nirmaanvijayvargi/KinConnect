Tech Stack: KinConnect Web
Architecture: Modern Serverless Web Application

Primary Language: JavaScript (ES6+) / React

1. Frontend (The User Interface)
Since this is a college project requiring a "professional yet rapid" build, the frontend is centered on ease of deployment and high-quality UI components.

Framework: React.js (Vite) * Why: Fast build times and a massive ecosystem for accessibility plugins.

UI Library: Ant Design (AntD) * Why: Excellent grid systems and pre-built components (Cards, Uploaders, Drawers) that are easy to theme with your Crimson Red palette.

State Management: React Context API * Why: Perfect for managing the "Time of Day" context and "Survivor vs. Caregiver" modes without the complexity of Redux.

Styling: CSS Modules or Styled Components * Why: To handle specific Aphasia-friendly adjustments like massive touch targets and high-contrast borders.

2. Backend-as-a-Service (Data & Auth)
Using Firebase allows you to skip writing a custom Node.js/Express server and focus entirely on the AI and UI logic.

Authentication: Firebase Auth * Why: Secure login for caregivers via Google or Email to keep family photos private.

Database: Cloud Firestore * Why: A NoSQL real-time database to sync the "Communication Tiles" instantly between the Caregiver’s phone and the Survivor’s tablet.

File Storage: Firebase Storage * Why: To store and serve the actual family photos uploaded by the caregiver.

3. AI & Intelligence Layer
This is the "Brain" of KinConnect that turns a photo into a communication tool.

Vision AI: Gemini 1.5 Flash API * Why: Extremely fast and low-cost vision processing. It will identify objects in the family photos and suggest "Intent Phrases."

Speech Engine: Web Speech API (Native Browser TTS) * Why: Zero-cost, zero-latency text-to-speech that works directly in Chrome/Safari without needing an external API key.

4. Deployment & DevOps
Hosting: Vercel * Why: Industry standard for React apps; provides a live URL for your college professors/judges to view the project instantly.

Version Control: GitHub * Why: Essential for collaboration and tracking your development phases.
