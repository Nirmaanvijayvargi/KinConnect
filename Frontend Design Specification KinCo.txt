Frontend Design Specification: KinConnect WebFramework: React.jsUI Library: Ant Design (AntD)Theme Style: Crimson / High-Contrast1. Theme Configuration (Ant Design)The frontend will utilize the AntD ConfigProvider to inject the Crimson theme globally. This ensures that every button, card, and notification aligns with the project's visual identity without manual styling.Primary Color: #D32F2F (Deep Crimson)Border Radius: 16px (Large, rounded corners for a "soft" tactile feel)Typography: Inter or system-ui (Bold weights for readability)Card Background: #FFFFFF with a subtle #FFF1F0 shadow.2. Main View ComponentsA. The Communication Grid (Survivor View)This is the primary interface. It is designed to be a "Kiosk" style, non-scrolling dashboard.Grid Layout: An AntD List or Flex container using a 3x2 or 4x2 layout depending on screen size.The Intent Card: * Image Section: Occupies 85% of the card. High-resolution family photos.Label Section: 15% of the card. Large, high-contrast text (e.g., "WASHROOM").Interaction: On-tap "Pulse" animation in Crimson to confirm the touch.B. The Caregiver "Management" DrawerA slide-out panel (using AntD Drawer) that stays hidden from the survivor to prevent confusion.Bulk Uploader: An AntD Upload.Dragger zone styled in light red.Status Tags: AI-processed images are tagged as Processing, Needs Review, or Active.3. Frontend Logic & StateI. Context-Aware FilteringA frontend hook (useTimeContext) will monitor the system clock.Morning Mode: Filters the Grid to show "Coffee," "Brush Teeth," "Medicine."Night Mode: Automatically swaps the Grid to "Sleep," "Water," "Light Off."II. The "Nudge" SystemAn AntD FloatButton or a top-level Alert that appears in a soft red hue if the user hasn't interacted with the screen for a set period during "active" hours.III. Voice Synthesis (TTS)Integration with the window.speechSynthesis API. When a card is clicked, the frontend immediately triggers the browser's native voice engine to speak the intentSentence stored in the card's data.4. Accessibility Implementation (Aphasia-Specific)FeatureTechnical SolutionNo Accidental ClicksImplement a 300ms debounce on all card click handlers.Visual FeedbackUse AntD Animate transitions so clicked cards "grow" slightly.Reading SupportAll text is rendered in Uppercase by default to assist with letter recognition.Touch PrecisionLarge padding (24px) between cards to prevent "fat-finger" errors.
