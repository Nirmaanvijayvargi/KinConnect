Phase 1: The "Crimson" Foundation
[ ] Initialize Project: Create a React app using Vite (npm create vite@latest).

[ ] Install Dependencies: * antd (UI Library)

firebase (Backend)

@google/generative-ai (Gemini API)

lucide-react (For clean, thin icons)

[ ] Theme Setup: Create a ThemeConfig.js using Ant Design’s ConfigProvider to set the Primary Red (#D32F2F) and large border-radius.

[ ] Firebase Config: Set up a Firebase project and paste the config keys into a .env file.

Phase 2: Caregiver Portal (The "Input" Side)
[ ] Image Uploader: Build a page using AntD Upload.Dragger for caregivers to drop family photos.

[ ] Gemini Integration: Write the function to send the uploaded image to Gemini 1.5 Flash to get an auto-label (e.g., "Fridge" -> "I am hungry").

[ ] Metadata Form: Create a simple AntD Modal where caregivers can confirm or edit the AI-generated label.

[ ] Firestore Sync: Save the Image URL (from Storage) and the Label (to Firestore) in a tiles collection.

Phase 3: The Survivor Interface (The "Output" Side)
[ ] The Communication Grid: Build a responsive grid using AntD Row and Col that pulls images from Firestore.

[ ] Large-Scale Cards: Style the cards so the image takes up almost the entire screen space.

[ ] Voice Synthesis: Map the onClick event of the cards to the window.speechSynthesis API to speak the intent out loud.

[ ] Click Feedback: Add a visual "ripple" or a thick Red border flash when a tile is tapped.

Phase 4: Intelligence & Context
[ ] Time-of-Day Filter: Write a logic helper that checks the current hour and sorts the tiles (e.g., show "Coffee" first if it's before 10 AM).

[ ] The "Nudge" Feature: Create a useEffect timer that triggers an AntD notification (in soft red) if the screen hasn't been touched in 2 hours.

[ ] Authentication: Lock the "Caregiver" settings behind a login screen so the Survivor doesn't accidentally change settings.

Phase 5: Final Polish & Demo
[ ] Responsive Testing: Ensure the grid looks perfect on a Tablet (iPad/Samsung Tab) since that is the most likely device for a survivor.

[ ] Deployment: Push the code to GitHub and connect it to Vercel.

[ ] Demo Content: Upload 5–10 "Real World" photos (dog, bed, water bottle, medicine) for a convincing presentation.
